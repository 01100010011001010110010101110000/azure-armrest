= 0.0.4 - ???
* All get/list/list_all methods now return wrapper class instances, e.g.
  a call to VirtualMachineService#get will return a VirtualMachine instance.
  These provide a nice OpenStruct wrapper so you can use methods instead
  of hash references if desired.
* Now re-raises RestClient exceptions as exceptions that we have defined.
* The VirtualMachineImage class was overhauled and is now working properly.
