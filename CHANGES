= 0.1.0 - 26-Jan-2015
* Refactored the ArmrestService class api_version and provider handling.
* The ArmrestService class no longer uses "preview" api versions by default.
* Added RBAC service classes.

= 0.0.9 - 17-Dec-2015
* Added AlertService and EventService classes.
* Added tables, table_info and table_data methods to the StorageAccount model.
* Updates to the README.

= 0.0.8 - 10-Nov-2015
* Added the list_private_images method to the StorageAccountService class.
* Added the list_all method to the ResourceGroupService class.
* Removed the EventService class for now. It did not actually work, and will
  eventually be re-implemented as part of a group of Insights classes.
* Added a .to_h and .to_hash method for the BaseModel class.

= 0.0.7 - 5-Nov-2015
* Refactored our BaseModel class so that it no longer uses Delegate or OpenStruct.
* Added more methods to the StorageAccount model, and modified methods so that
  any options are always the last argument.
* Bug fix for the StorageAccount#all_blobs method.

= 0.0.6 - 23-Oct-2015
* Defined a custom == method for the BaseModel class.
* The TemplateDeployment#properties.outputs now returns a hash.
* Temporarily use a BaseModel hash ref instead of a method name due to name
  collision with ManageIQ until a general solution is worked out.

= 0.0.5 - 21-Oct-2015
* The VirtualMachineService#series method now returns VirtualMachineSize
  objects instead of a raw hash.
* Fixed a bug in the Network::IpAddress::Service class.
* Cleaned up some spec warnings.

= 0.0.4 - 19-Oct-2015
* All get/list/list_all methods now return wrapper class instances, e.g.
  a call to VirtualMachineService#get will return a VirtualMachine instance.
  These provide a nice OpenStruct wrapper so you can use methods instead
  of hash references if desired.
* A custom StorageAccount class was added that implements methods for
  gathering blob information.
* Most service classes now inherit from ResourceGroupBasedService, which
  provides a common set of methods typically used for various services.
* Now re-raises RestClient exceptions as exceptions that we have defined.
* The VirtualMachineImage class was overhauled and is now working properly.
* The azure-signature, nokogiri and activesupport dependencies were added.

= 0.0.3 - 13-Oct-2015
* Bug fixes for VirtualMachineImageService class.
* Reorganized and updated SubnetService class.
* Some updates to the BaseModel in prep for JSON wrapper classes.
* Added NetworkSecurityGroupService and IpAddressService classes.

= 0.0.2 - 23-Sep-2015
* Revamped class names. Now use "Service" instead of "Manager".
* Several new service classes added, updated, and refactored.
* All service classes now take and store configuration information as the
  first argument to ensure distinct credentials.
* Added Bill Wei as author.

= 0.0.1 - 13-Aug-2015
* Initial release
